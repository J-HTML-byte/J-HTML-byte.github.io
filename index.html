        <h3>10th January , 2021
A
fter lunch we went on a hiking trip to a lookout 
after a while, we went saw a fork in the road.
We went to the left side ,which took us on a small trail 
in the mountain, on one side there were ferns ,lots and lots of them 
and it pricked me, ouch! At first there were a lot of people , but as we 
climbed higher and higher , there were only trees and lots of ferns
soon it became (in my opinion) was kind of spooky, even though I can
see Central ,the trees were shrilled  , crooked , twisted , bent and bare,
and there was no one in miles, so I suggested we go down the mountain
before dark, since it was dusk already. After some exploring , because
my sister insisted, actually she bugged me, when I said no to her 20 times,
 we went home , happy.</h3>
